## Files

### Reference Data

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `vendor_master.csv` | Master list of 25 vendors with categories, payment terms, approved currencies, spend thresholds, and status (3 INACTIVE vendors, 1 requiring dual approval) |
| `historic_invoices.csv` | 120 historical invoice records from Jan 2024 – Jun 2025, used for duplicate detection and pattern validation |
| `data_dictionary.md` | Field-level descriptions for all columns in both CSV files |

**Invoice PDFs table:**

**| File	| Description |**
| invoices | A batch of 17 vendor invoices in PDF format representing a typical working day. Invoices vary in layout, quality, and vendor type. Your solution must process all of them. |

**Key Relationships and Test Cases:**

**Business rules your solution must handle:**

**Vendor validation:** Every invoice must be matched against vendor_master.csv. Invoices from vendors not present in the master, or from vendors with status = INACTIVE, should be flagged and held.
**Currency validation:** Each vendor has an approved_currency in the master. Invoices submitted in a different currency should be flagged for review.
**Spend threshold:** Each vendor has a spend_threshold_eur. Invoices exceeding this value should be flagged before reaching an approver.
**Dual approval:** Vendors with requires_dual_approval = TRUE must be routed for two approvals regardless of amount.
**Duplicate detection:** Cross-reference each incoming invoice against historic_invoices.csv. Flag invoices that appear to be duplicates or near-duplicates of previously processed ones.
**Mandatory fields:** Invoices missing required fields (such as PO number) should be held pending completion.
